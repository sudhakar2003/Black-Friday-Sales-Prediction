# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
This project aims to predict the sales amount of products during the Black Friday sale event based on various factors. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data and extract patterns that can help predict future sales.

Key components of the project include:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset contains information about sales transactions during previous Black Friday events, including features such as customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and other relevant information.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are used to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (sales amount).

3. **Feature Engineering**: This involves selecting and transforming features that are most relevant to the prediction task. It may include creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

4. **Model Selection and Training**: Various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression are trained on the dataset to predict sales amounts.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess their performance in predicting sales amounts.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameters of the models are tuned using techniques such as grid search or randomized search to improve their performance.

7. **Prediction and Deployment**: The best-performing model is used to make predictions on new data. The model can be deployed in a production environment to predict sales amounts during future Black Friday events.

8. **Conclusion**: The project concludes by highlighting the importance of accurate sales predictions for retailers to optimize their marketing strategies, inventory management, and pricing strategies during Black Friday sales events.

By accurately predicting sales amounts, retailers can better understand customer behavior, optimize their product offerings, and maximize their profits during the Black Friday sales event.
